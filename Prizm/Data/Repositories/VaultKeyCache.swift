/// In-memory cache mapping cipher IDs to their effective 64-byte symmetric keys
/// (encryptionKey ‖ macKey).
///
/// - Security goal: keeps per-cipher key material close to where it is used
///   (attachment operations) without storing it on `VaultItem` domain entities,
///   which would expose key material to the Presentation layer.
///
/// - Populated at sync time by `SyncRepositoryImpl` via `populate(keys:)`, using the
///   effective cipher keys returned by `CipherMapper`. Cleared alongside the vault
///   store on lock/sign-out.
///
/// - Thread safety: declared as `actor` because it is written from the sync path
///   (background `actor SyncRepositoryImpl`) and read from attachment operation paths
///   (`VaultKeyServiceImpl`). An `actor` prevents data races under Swift 6 strict
///   concurrency checking (Constitution §II — "actor for shared mutable state in
///   Data layer").
