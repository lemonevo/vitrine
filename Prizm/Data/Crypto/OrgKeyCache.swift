/// In-memory cache mapping organization IDs to their unwrapped symmetric keys.
///
/// - Security goal: keeps org key material in the Data layer behind a protocol boundary,
///   preventing exposure to the Presentation layer. Org keys are zeroed before removal
///   (Constitution §III) to reduce the heap-residency window after lock.
///
/// - Populated at sync time by `SyncRepositoryImpl` after unwrapping each org's RSA-encrypted
///   symmetric key. Cleared alongside `VaultKeyCache` on vault lock and sign-out.
///   Reference: Bitwarden Security Whitepaper §4 — "Organization Key Wrapping".
///
/// - Thread safety: declared as `actor` because it is written from the sync path
///   (background `actor SyncRepositoryImpl`) and read from `CipherMapper` via a
///   synchronous snapshot. An `actor` prevents data races under Swift 6 strict
///   concurrency checking (Constitution §II — "actor for shared mutable state in
///   Data layer").
