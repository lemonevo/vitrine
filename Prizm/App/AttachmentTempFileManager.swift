/// Cleanup strategy:
/// - Each registered file has a 30-second deletion deadline.
/// - `cleanup()` is called on every foreground transition (via `NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification`)
///   and by a scheduled Task inside `AttachmentRowViewModel` 30 s after registration.
/// - On cleanup, the file is overwritten with zeros then deleted (Constitution §III).
///
/// Thread safety: `entries` is protected by a `Lock` because `register` and `cleanup`
/// may be called from background Tasks or notification callbacks.
