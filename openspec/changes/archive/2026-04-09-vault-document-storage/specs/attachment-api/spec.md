## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Upload attachment via two-step v2 signed-URL flow
The system SHALL upload an attachment using the v2 Bitwarden Attachments API. The v2 endpoint separates metadata creation from file upload:
1. `POST /api/ciphers/{cipherId}/attachment/v2` with JSON body `{ "fileName": "<encryptedFileName>", "key": "<encryptedAttachmentKey>", "fileSize": <plaintextSizeBytes> }` and `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. The file name SHALL be encrypted as an EncString using the cipher key before sending.
2. The server response SHALL include `{ "attachmentId": "...", "url": "<signedUrl>", "fileUploadType": 0|1 }`.
3. For `fileUploadType` = `0` (Vaultwarden direct): `POST /api/ciphers/{cipherId}/attachment/{attachmentId}` (the `url` field resolves to this path) with the encrypted blob as the multipart form body field `data`.
4. For `fileUploadType` = `1` (Azure blob): `PUT <signedUrl>` with the encrypted blob as the raw request body and header `x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob`.

#### Scenario: Step 1 POST is to the v2 endpoint and returns metadata with signed URL
- **WHEN** a valid POST is sent to `/api/ciphers/{id}/attachment/v2`
- **THEN** the response SHALL contain `attachmentId`, `url`, and `fileUploadType`

#### Scenario: Vaultwarden direct upload succeeds
- **WHEN** `fileUploadType` is `0`
- **THEN** the encrypted blob SHALL be uploaded via POST to the signed URL as multipart form data

#### Scenario: Azure blob upload sets correct header
- **WHEN** `fileUploadType` is `1`
- **THEN** the encrypted blob SHALL be uploaded via PUT with `x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob`

#### Scenario: Upload interrupted — metadata exists but file is missing
- **WHEN** the app crashes or loses connectivity after step 1 but before step 2 completes
- **THEN** on next sync the orphaned attachment (metadata with no downloadable file) SHALL be shown as "Upload incomplete" in the detail pane with a Retry option

---

### Requirement: Download attachment via signed URL
The system SHALL download an attachment on demand (not during sync). The download flow:
1. If `Attachment.url` from the sync payload is non-nil, use it directly as the download URL (skipping the GET step). Otherwise, `GET /api/ciphers/{cipherId}/attachment/{attachmentId}` with `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` → response includes `{ "url": "<signedUrl>", ... }`, then use the returned URL.
2. `GET <signedUrl>` → raw encrypted blob
3. Decrypt blob using the attachment key (itself decrypted from the EncString metadata using the cipher key)

The system SHALL NOT cache the downloaded encrypted blob to disk. The decrypted plaintext SHALL be handled per the `attachment-view-flow` spec (temp file or save panel).

#### Scenario: Download uses sync URL when available
- **WHEN** `Attachment.url` is non-nil
- **THEN** the system SHALL GET the encrypted blob directly from that URL without a separate metadata fetch

#### Scenario: Download fetches fresh URL when sync URL is absent
- **WHEN** `Attachment.url` is nil
- **THEN** the system SHALL first GET the attachment record to obtain a signed download URL, then GET the encrypted blob from that URL

#### Scenario: Signed URL expiry is handled
- **WHEN** the download URL returns HTTP 403
- **THEN** the system SHALL re-request a fresh signed URL once and retry the download; if the retry also fails, an error SHALL be shown

---

### Requirement: Delete attachment
The system SHALL delete an attachment via `DELETE /api/ciphers/{cipherId}/attachment/{attachmentId}` with `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. On a 200 response, the attachment SHALL be removed from the in-memory vault cache immediately. No local cleanup is needed (attachment data is server-side only).

#### Scenario: Successful delete removes attachment from detail pane
- **WHEN** the server returns 200 for the DELETE request
- **THEN** the attachment SHALL disappear from the detail pane attachment list without requiring a full re-sync

#### Scenario: Delete failure shows inline error
- **WHEN** the server returns a non-200 status for DELETE
- **THEN** an inline error SHALL appear in the detail pane and the attachment SHALL remain visible

#### Scenario: Delete of incomplete attachment removes orphaned metadata
- **WHEN** the user deletes an attachment with `isUploadIncomplete` = `true`
- **THEN** the system SHALL call `DELETE /api/ciphers/{cipherId}/attachment/{attachmentId}` — the server removes the orphaned metadata row regardless of whether a blob was ever uploaded; the row SHALL disappear from the detail pane on success

---

### Requirement: Structured logging for all attachment operations
All attachment network and crypto operations SHALL emit structured log entries via `os.Logger` with subsystem `com.prizm` and category `attachments`. Log levels SHALL follow §V of the Constitution: `.debug` for trace (e.g. "starting upload for cipherId X"), `.info` for normal flow completion (e.g. "attachment uploaded successfully"), `.error` for recoverable faults (e.g. network failure, 402 response), `.fault` for unrecoverable states. Secrets (attachment keys, file contents, access tokens) MUST NOT appear in any log output.

#### Scenario: Upload start and success are logged at correct levels
- **WHEN** an upload begins
- **THEN** a `.debug` entry SHALL be emitted; on success a `.info` entry SHALL be emitted; neither SHALL contain key material or file contents

#### Scenario: Network failure during upload is logged at .error
- **WHEN** a network error occurs during upload
- **THEN** a `.error` entry SHALL be emitted with a description of the failure but no secret data

---

### Requirement: Premium gate — surface server error, don't pre-check
The system SHALL NOT call any profile or billing API to check premium status before showing the Add Attachment UI. If the server returns HTTP 402 or an error body indicating a premium subscription is required, the system SHALL display: "Attachments require a Bitwarden Premium account." Vaultwarden users are unaffected.

#### Scenario: HTTP 402 on upload shows premium message
- **WHEN** the server returns HTTP 402 during the attachment POST
- **THEN** the error "Attachments require a Bitwarden Premium account." SHALL be shown inline in the add flow

#### Scenario: Add Attachment button is always visible
- **WHEN** a vault item detail pane is shown
- **THEN** the Add Attachment button SHALL be visible regardless of the user's subscription status
