## Purpose

Defines the detail pane UI for viewing, opening, saving, deleting, and retrying file attachments.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Attachments section in detail pane lists all attachments
The vault item detail pane SHALL include an "Attachments" section below the existing field cards for every cipher type, regardless of whether the cipher has any attachments. Each attachment SHALL appear as a row displaying the decrypted file name and human-readable file size. The section SHALL also contain an "Add Attachment" button at the bottom (see `attachment-add-flow`). When a cipher has no attachments, the section SHALL still be present with only the "Add Attachment" button visible.

#### Scenario: Attachments section shows file name and size per row
- **WHEN** a vault item with attachments is selected
- **THEN** each attachment SHALL appear as a row showing its plaintext file name and size

#### Scenario: Attachments section shows Add Attachment button even with no attachments
- **WHEN** a vault item with no attachments is selected
- **THEN** an Attachments section SHALL be present containing only the "Add Attachment" button

---

### Requirement: Upload-incomplete attachments are shown with retry option
If a sync response includes an attachment whose `url` is nil and whose metadata cannot be resolved to a downloadable file (indicating a prior upload was interrupted after the metadata POST but before the blob upload), the attachment row SHALL be shown in a degraded "Upload incomplete" state. The row SHALL display the decrypted file name, a visual indicator distinguishing it from normal rows, and a "Retry Upload" button. Pressing "Retry Upload" SHALL re-prompt the user to select a file via `NSOpenPanel` and re-initiate the two-step upload flow. Pressing Delete SHALL behave identically to the normal delete flow.

#### Scenario: Incomplete attachment is shown as degraded
- **WHEN** a synced cipher has an attachment with no resolvable download URL
- **THEN** the attachment row SHALL display a "Upload incomplete" indicator and a "Retry Upload" button instead of the Open/Save actions

#### Scenario: Retry Upload deletes orphaned metadata then does a fresh upload
- **WHEN** the user presses "Retry Upload" on an incomplete attachment
- **THEN** an `NSOpenPanel` SHALL open so the user can select a file; on confirm the system SHALL (1) call `DeleteAttachmentUseCase.execute` to remove the orphaned server metadata, then (2) call `UploadAttachmentUseCase.execute` as a fresh upload — the new attachment receives a new server-assigned ID and replaces the incomplete row on success; the old incomplete row SHALL disappear

---

### Requirement: Open decrypts and opens attachment in default app
Each attachment row SHALL have an "Open" action. Pressing it SHALL:
1. Download and decrypt the attachment on a background `Task`
2. Write the plaintext bytes to a temp file in a `FileManager`-managed temp directory
3. Open the temp file via `NSWorkspace.shared.open(_:)`
4. After 30 seconds, overwrite the temp file with zeroes and delete it

A row-level progress indicator SHALL be shown during download and decryption. If the operation fails, an inline error SHALL appear on the row.

#### Scenario: Open downloads, decrypts, and launches default app
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Open" on an attachment row
- **THEN** the system SHALL download and decrypt the file in the background and open it with the system default app for its file type

#### Scenario: Temp file is zeroed and deleted 30 seconds after open
- **WHEN** 30 seconds have elapsed after the temp file was written
- **THEN** the temp file SHALL be overwritten with zeroes and deleted

#### Scenario: Open failure shows inline row error
- **WHEN** download or decryption fails
- **THEN** an inline error SHALL appear on the attachment row; no temp file SHALL remain on disk

---

### Requirement: Save to Disk decrypts and saves via NSSavePanel
Each attachment row SHALL have a "Save to Disk" action. Pressing it SHALL open an `NSSavePanel` pre-filled with the original (decrypted) file name. After the user confirms a save location, the system SHALL download and decrypt the attachment on a background `Task` and write the plaintext to the chosen path. The in-memory plaintext buffer SHALL be zeroed immediately after the write completes.

#### Scenario: Save to Disk pre-fills original file name in NSSavePanel
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Save to Disk" on an attachment row
- **THEN** the `NSSavePanel` SHALL open with the attachment's decrypted file name pre-filled

#### Scenario: Plaintext written to user-chosen path and buffer zeroed
- **WHEN** the user confirms a save location
- **THEN** the decrypted bytes SHALL be written to that path and the in-memory buffer SHALL be zeroed immediately after

#### Scenario: Cancelling NSSavePanel writes nothing
- **WHEN** the user cancels the NSSavePanel
- **THEN** no file SHALL be written and no download SHALL be initiated

---

### Requirement: Delete attachment with confirmation
Each attachment row SHALL have a delete action. Selecting it SHALL present a confirmation alert: "Delete attachment "<fileName>"? This cannot be undone." Confirming SHALL call `DELETE /api/ciphers/{id}/attachment/{attachmentId}`; on success the row SHALL be removed from the list. Cancelling SHALL leave the attachment unchanged.

#### Scenario: Delete shows confirmation alert with file name
- **WHEN** the user triggers delete on an attachment row
- **THEN** an alert SHALL appear: "Delete attachment "<fileName>"? This cannot be undone."

#### Scenario: Confirmed delete removes row from detail pane
- **WHEN** the user confirms the delete alert and the server returns 200
- **THEN** the attachment row SHALL disappear from the Attachments section

#### Scenario: Cancelled delete leaves attachment unchanged
- **WHEN** the user dismisses the delete alert without confirming
- **THEN** the attachment SHALL remain in the list unchanged

#### Scenario: Delete server failure shows inline error
- **WHEN** the server returns a non-200 response for the delete
- **THEN** an inline error SHALL appear and the attachment SHALL remain visible
