## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Organization and Collection domain entities exist
The Domain layer SHALL define an `Organization` struct with fields: `id: String`, `name: String`, `role: OrgRole`, and `canManageCollections: Bool` (derived from role). `OrgRole` SHALL be an enum: `.owner`, `.admin`, `.manager`, `.user`, `.custom`. The Domain layer SHALL define an `OrgCollection` struct with fields: `id: String`, `organizationId: String`, `name: String`. Both are value types (`struct`). No crypto imports in the Domain layer.

> **Implementation note:** The entity was named `OrgCollection` (not `Collection`) to avoid a name collision with Swift's standard library `Collection` protocol.

#### Scenario: Organization entity accessible from Domain layer
- **WHEN** a use case or repository protocol references `Organization`
- **THEN** it SHALL compile with `import Foundation` only (no crypto, no SwiftUI)

#### Scenario: canManageCollections reflects role
- **GIVEN** an `Organization` with role `.user`
- **WHEN** `canManageCollections` is read
- **THEN** it SHALL return `false`

#### Scenario: canManageCollections true for admin roles
- **GIVEN** an `Organization` with role `.owner`, `.admin`, or `.manager`
- **WHEN** `canManageCollections` is read
- **THEN** it SHALL return `true`

#### Scenario: canManageCollections false for custom role
- **GIVEN** an `Organization` with role `.custom`
- **WHEN** `canManageCollections` is read
- **THEN** it SHALL return `false` (Bitwarden custom-role collection permissions require server-side permission flags not available in the sync `type` integer; default to deny)

---

### Requirement: Organizations and collections are decoded from sync response
`SyncResponse` SHALL decode `organizations: [RawOrganization]` and `collections: [RawCollection]` arrays from the Bitwarden `/sync` endpoint. Both arrays SHALL default to `[]` when absent (for Vaultwarden instances without org support). `RawOrganization` SHALL include: `id`, `name`, `key` (RSA-encrypted EncString), `type` (Int: 0=Owner, 1=Admin, 2=User, 3=Manager, 4=Custom). `RawCollection` SHALL include: `id`, `organizationId`, `name` (EncString encrypted with org key).

#### Scenario: Sync response with organizations decoded
- **WHEN** the `/sync` endpoint returns an `Organizations` array
- **THEN** `SyncResponse.organizations` SHALL contain the decoded entries

#### Scenario: Sync response without organizations defaults to empty
- **WHEN** the `/sync` endpoint omits the `Organizations` key
- **THEN** `SyncResponse.organizations` SHALL be `[]` without throwing

#### Scenario: Collection names decrypted with org key
- **WHEN** sync populates collections
- **THEN** each collection's name SHALL be decrypted using the org's symmetric key from `OrgKeyCache`

---

### Requirement: Sidebar displays an Organizations section with nested collections
The sidebar SHALL display an "Organizations" section below the Folders section. Each organization SHALL appear as a disclosure group showing the org name. Within each org, each collection the user has access to SHALL appear as a child row showing the collection name and a badge with the count of items assigned to it. Selecting an org row SHALL show all items across all of that org's collections. Selecting a collection row SHALL show only items whose `collectionIds` contains that collection's id.

#### Scenario: Organizations section appears below Folders
- **WHEN** the vault browser opens and the user belongs to at least one organization
- **THEN** an "Organizations" section SHALL appear in the sidebar below the Folders section

#### Scenario: Selecting an org shows all its items
- **WHEN** the user selects an organization row in the sidebar
- **THEN** the item list SHALL show all items belonging to any collection in that org

#### Scenario: Selecting a collection filters to that collection
- **WHEN** the user selects a collection row under an org
- **THEN** the item list SHALL show only items whose `collectionIds` contains that collection's id

#### Scenario: Collection item count badge is accurate
- **GIVEN** a collection contains 5 items
- **WHEN** the sidebar renders
- **THEN** the collection row SHALL display a badge showing 5

#### Scenario: No Organizations section when user has no orgs
- **WHEN** the user belongs to no organizations
- **THEN** no "Organizations" section SHALL appear in the sidebar

---

### Requirement: User can create a collection (role-gated)
Each org's disclosure header in the sidebar SHALL display a `+` button when `canManageCollections == true` for that org (always visible on the header, matching the Folders section pattern). Clicking the button SHALL create an inline editable row for the collection name (matching the folder creation UX pattern). Committing a non-empty name SHALL encrypt it with the org key and call `POST /organizations/{orgId}/collections`. Pressing Escape or submitting an empty name SHALL cancel without an API call. When `canManageCollections == false`, no `+` button SHALL appear on that org's header.

#### Scenario: Create button visible for admin role
- **GIVEN** the user has role Admin or Owner in the org
- **WHEN** the user selects that org in the sidebar
- **THEN** a `+` button SHALL appear on the Organizations section or org disclosure header

#### Scenario: Create button hidden for user role
- **GIVEN** the user has role User in the org
- **WHEN** the sidebar renders
- **THEN** no collection `+` button SHALL be displayed for that org

#### Scenario: Commit creates collection via API
- **GIVEN** the user types "Dev Tools" in the inline collection name field
- **WHEN** the user presses Enter
- **THEN** the name SHALL be encrypted with the org key and sent via `POST /organizations/{orgId}/collections`
- **AND** the new collection SHALL appear in the sidebar sorted alphabetically

#### Scenario: Escape cancels collection creation
- **WHEN** the user presses Escape while editing a new collection name
- **THEN** the row SHALL be removed with no API call

#### Scenario: Server error during collection creation
- **GIVEN** the user commits a valid collection name
- **WHEN** the server returns an error
- **THEN** the uncommitted collection row SHALL be removed and an error alert SHALL be shown

---

### Requirement: User can rename a collection (role-gated)
Right-clicking a collection row SHALL show a context menu with "Rename" (only if `canManageCollections == true` for that org). Selecting Rename SHALL activate inline editing. Committing a non-empty name SHALL encrypt it with the org key and call `PUT /organizations/{orgId}/collections/{id}`.

#### Scenario: Rename available for admin role
- **GIVEN** the user has role Admin or Owner in the org
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a collection
- **THEN** a "Rename" option SHALL appear in the context menu

#### Scenario: Rename not available for user role
- **GIVEN** the user has role User in the org
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a collection
- **THEN** no "Rename" option SHALL appear

#### Scenario: Commit rename updates collection name
- **GIVEN** the user is renaming a collection to "Infrastructure"
- **WHEN** the user presses Enter
- **THEN** the name SHALL be encrypted and sent via `PUT /organizations/{orgId}/collections/{id}`
- **AND** the collection SHALL re-sort alphabetically

#### Scenario: Server error during collection rename
- **GIVEN** the user commits a valid new collection name
- **WHEN** the server returns an error
- **THEN** the collection name SHALL revert to its previous value and an error alert SHALL be shown

---

### Requirement: User can delete a collection (role-gated)
Right-clicking a collection row SHALL show a context menu with "Delete Collection" (only if `canManageCollections == true`). Confirming deletion SHALL call `DELETE /organizations/{orgId}/collections/{id}`. Items that were in the deleted collection SHALL remain in the vault (they are not deleted — their `collectionIds` simply no longer matches a known collection).

#### Scenario: Delete option available for admin role
- **GIVEN** the user has role Admin or Owner in the org
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a collection
- **THEN** a "Delete Collection" option SHALL appear in the context menu

#### Scenario: Confirmation required before delete
- **WHEN** the user selects "Delete Collection"
- **THEN** a confirmation alert SHALL appear before the API call is made

#### Scenario: Collection removed from sidebar after delete
- **GIVEN** the user confirms deletion
- **WHEN** `DELETE /organizations/{orgId}/collections/{id}` succeeds
- **THEN** the collection row SHALL be removed from the sidebar

#### Scenario: Server error during collection deletion
- **GIVEN** the user confirms deletion
- **WHEN** the server returns an error
- **THEN** the collection SHALL remain in the sidebar unchanged and an error alert SHALL be shown
